<b><u>sumit:</u></b>   
The best and most beautiful things 
in the world cannot be seen or even touched
 - they must be felt with the heart.

<b><u>dhruv: </b></u>   
As we express our gratitude, 
we must never forget that the highest 
appreciation is not to utter words, 
but to live by them.

<b><u>vrishti: </b></u>   
Today I choose life. 
Every morning when I wake up
 I can choose joy, happiness, negativity, pain... 
To feel the freedom that comes 
from being able to continue to 
make mistakes and choices - today 
I choose to feel life, not to deny my humanity 
but embrace it.

<b><u>hamza: </b></u>   
Your big opportunity may be right
 where you are now.
